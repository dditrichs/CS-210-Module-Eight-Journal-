//Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was designed to show users how their investments will grow over time. This is done by calculating and sowing year end balances with interest for both if monthly deposits are made and not made.

//What did you do particularly well?

In this project I used functional methods to calculate the necessary numbers to display. The output was made user friendly and very readable for the end user.

//Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

To enchance this could I would begin by adding error handling for inputs that do not match up to the programs functionality. This would enhance the program to be more secure and better functionally overall

//Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The hardest piece to write was the functions to handle compounding interest of many years. To create this I verified the numbers outputting were correct by checking with a calculator.

//What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

This project help with real time problem solving such as the financial numbers I worked with. This could be transferred to other financial or overall real life problem solving programs.

//How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The program is structured into different blocks of functions and output statements to be able to modify easier. By coding in blocks I am also able to go back and modify different parts as needed.
